This is a solution to a [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) on Frontend Mentor.

I built this with AI and then manually corrected the problems. Not the best approach for learning, but I wanted to try out an AI-with-human-caretaking approach.

### Stuff I'm pleased with myself for:
- Using variables more effectively.
- BEM naming system for classes (mostly).
- Not directly using AI this time (i.e. I asked ChatGPT when stuck, but turned off coding suggestions in the IDE).
- Using `text-box-trim` and `text-box-edge` to get the spacing underneath the h2 titles closer to how it is in Figma — was finding that very frustrating.
- Learning more about styling tables.

### Stuff for me to think about next time:
- Perhaps I'm over-using `flex-direction` and `gap` for layout? It's my comfort zone because it corresponds with how Figma organises everything. If not I'm wondering what big missing essentials are for CSS, because it feels like I can already do most layouts with the parts I'm aware of.
- Figuring out how to create font variables better — I could replicate Figma text-styles in CSS, but I think this would be clunky.
- Next time I want to list out all the CSS classes from the start, instead of making them up as a I go along.
